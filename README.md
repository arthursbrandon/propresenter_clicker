# propresenter_clicker

This program allows a wireless slide clicker to control ProPresenter by sending API requests
to a running ProPresenter Network Interface. It enables slide transitions without requiring the ProPresenter window tp be in focus on the host PC.

Usage
1. Ensure ProPresenter is running with its API enabled.
2. Start this program on the host machine.
3. Use your clicker to move forward and backward through slides

Installation
1. Download the latest executable
2. Run the executable

Platform Support
- Windows: Fully supported

Security Note
This application listens for keyboard input in order to detect slide clicker events.
It does not log, store, or transmit keystrokes beyond controlling ProPresenter.
